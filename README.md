# Xiaomi-LYWSD03MMC-ESP32-BLE-MQTT

In this project an ESP32-WROOM-32D is used to extract temperature and humidity information from a Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC (Xiaomi Mi Temperature and Humidity Monitor 2) sensor via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). Once the data is captured it is advertised via the MQTT publish and subscribe messaging protocol in JSON format. The thermohygrometer works with the custom firmware ATC_MiThermometer, more information on this link: https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer.
